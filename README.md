# CharityToken Smart Contract

CharityToken (CHRT) is an ERC20-based smart contract built on Ethereum, allowing users to donate tokens to registered charities. This project aims to provide a decentralized and transparent platform where users can register as donors, donate tokens to approved charities, and charities can receive these donations in the form of ERC20 tokens.


## Description 

**CharityToken** is a Solidity-based ERC20 smart contract designed for transparent and decentralized charitable donations. It enables users to donate tokens to registered charities, with all transactions tracked on the blockchain. The contract supports the following functionalities:

- **ERC20 Token (CHRT)**: A standard token used for donations.
- **Charity Registration**: Only the contract owner can register new charities by providing their address and name.
- **Donor Registration**: Any user can register as a donor to participate in donations.
- **Token Donations**: Donors can send tokens to registered charities, with both donations and charity receipts tracked.
- **Minting Tokens**: The contract owner can mint new tokens to increase the total supply.
- **Burning Tokens**: Any token holder can burn tokens, reducing the total supply.
- **View Charities and Donors**: Both charities and donors can view their records of donations and receipts.

This project provides a secure and efficient way to manage donations through blockchain technology.
## Getting Started 

## Executng programs 

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., First.sol). Copy and paste the following given code into the created file.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.0" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile First.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar.
